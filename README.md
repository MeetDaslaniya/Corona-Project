# Learning Web Development

Welcome to my learning website project repository! This is a simple website created for the purpose of learning HTML and CSS. My name is Meet Daslaniya, and I'm currently exploring web development.

## About the Project

This project is a basic website developed using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a practical exercise to apply the concepts learned. The design for this website was inspired by a template found on Figma. You can view the original Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1D4ogjcJdVDEL5SxDkJhpp/Figma-Website-Template-Demo.-FREEBIES-Landing-page-.-covid-home-care--%40atik_gohel-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Kn8o6gvoYJ3bxmqa-1).

## Website Deployment

The website is deployed using Netlify. You can access the deployed version of the website [here](https://662f44de0acda671e64364e7--dreamy-bublanina-91449b.netlify.app/).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning projects. If you have any suggestions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Explore the HTML and CSS files to understand the structure and styling.
